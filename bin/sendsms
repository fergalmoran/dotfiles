## Values received by this script:
# To = $1 (Phone number to text, specified in the Zabbix web interface; "+12345678")
# Subject = $2 (usually either PROBLEM or RECOVERY)
# Message = $3 (whatever message the Zabbix action sends, preferably something like "Zabbix server is unreachable for 5 minutes - Zabbix server (127.0.0.1)")

# Get the Phone number and subject ($2 - hopefully either PROBLEM or RECOVERY)
